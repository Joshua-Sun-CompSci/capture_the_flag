# capture_the_flag
A Haskell-based "Capture the Flag" game where a human player competes against a computer AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with a static board evaluation to determine optimal moves. Players take turns to either capture the opponent's flag or block moves. Includes a simple command-line interface for human-computer interaction.
